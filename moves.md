#Conventions of the Fiction Podcast
##Organization
The organization of a pod cast has to do with the pattern in which a podcast is set up. In the world of fiction podcasting, there are many ways to set up a podcast based on the type of storyline that is being told. When listening to the two fiction podcasts I focused on,  two distinct patterns of story telling immerged.
###Season Story
The  first series of podcasts I listened to were from the series, _The Black Tapes_ . I noticed that this series of podcasts were organized in 20 episode seasons in which one plot line is carried on throughout each episode. This way of structuring a story brings the listeners in by engaging them in a long, complex mystery plot that builds from episode to episode.
###Episode Story
 The second series of podcasts I listened to were from a show called _Campfire Radio Theater_ . Each podcast told a story that was self-contained with in that episode, meaning that each new episode was its own short story. This short story pattern is effective in capturing the attention of an audience because it allows for listeners to to engage with each episode individually, as opposed to a Series approach, in which each episode is connected by an overarching plot.
Examples of some of my favorite episodes:
*Abduction at Willow Woods
*Woods Ferry
*Night Delivery
