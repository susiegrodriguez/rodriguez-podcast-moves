#Conventions of the Fiction Podcast
##Organization
The organization of a pod cast has to do with the pattern in which a podcast is set up. In the world of fiction podcasting, there are many ways to set up a podcast based on the type of storyline that is being told. When listening to the two fiction podcasts I focused on,  two distinct patterns of story telling immerged.
###Season Story
The  first series of podcasts I listened to were from the series, _The Black Tapes_ . I noticed that this series of podcasts were organized in 20 episode seasons in which one plot line is carried on throughout each episode. This way of structuring a story brings the listeners in by engaging them in a long, complex mystery plot that builds from episode to episode.
###Episode Story
 The second series of podcasts I listened to were from a show called _Campfire Radio Theater_ . Each podcast told a story that was self-contained with in that episode, meaning that each new episode was its own short story. This short story pattern is effective in capturing the attention of an audience because it allows for listeners to to engage with each episode individually, as opposed to a Series approach, in which each episode is connected by an overarching plot.
Examples of some of my favorite episodes:
* Abduction at Willow Woods
* Woods Ferry
* Night Delivery

##Style
Each podcasts engaged in a number of stylistic techniques.
###Soundscape
Both _The Black Tapes_ and _Campfire Radio Theater_  engaged in extensive use of sound effects in order to create a realistic atmosphere for the listeners.
* phone use --Many episodes of _The Black Tapes_ , the characters are involved in phone conversations. The sound effects used made it seem as is one characters was actually talking through the phone to another character by distorting the the character’s voice. In episode
* 3D binaural audio experience – In the Episode of Campfire Radio Theater, “Abduction at Willow Woods”, they use an immersive technology that creates a realistic almost 3D sound experience for the listener. This is accomplished, as they say in the introduction to the episode, by recreating how the human ear works using recoding devices and a dummy head.

* background noise : Doors Slamming, feet crunching on dry leaves, and voice coming from off, all of these things are utilized in both _The Black Tapes_ and _Campfire Radio Theater_ .  In episode 212 of (TBT) the main character, Regan, is having a conversation with another character in a cave and they use sound effects to make their voices have realistic echoes.  In “Abduction at Willow Woods”, there is a scene in which they are driving on the highway. They utilize sound effects to emulate honking horns and cars rushing by. This fully immerses the listener in a


###Music
* Change in Scene – In night delivery, and other episodes of CRT, the change in scene is often indicated by creepy music. This adds to the macabre tone of the episode and also makes in easier for the listener to follow what is happening.
Music in

* Mood Music—Music in TBT is an integral part of setting the mood of each scene. In the climax of episode 210, music is utilized in order to add to the suspense of the listener.


###Narrator
* Introduction to episode –  In both CRT and TBT, each episode is introduced by a narrator. In CRT the introduction involved the writer of the show setting the scene for the story and sometimes giving a little information about the technology used in recording the show. For example, in “The Abduction at Willow Woods”, he gave the listeners some background information about the 3D binaural audio technology that the used.
* In episode narration— In TBT is presented in a more journalistic style so  the narrator is a central character in the story. This allows them to use the narrator for to introduce certain scenes with her own insight, for example, or introduce a scene change.  For example, in episode 212, at the end of a scene she narrates, “That night was long. Strand and I talked about a lot of things, including the begging of the black tape.” this give the listener insight into the mind of the narrator and contributes to the realistic documentary type feel.
